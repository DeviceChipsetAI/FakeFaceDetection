# FakeFaceDetection
Detection of fake face which generated by Deepfake or other face swapping algorithms. 

the repo is to implement a model for Kaggle Dataset "Real and Fake Face detection". you can get more information from https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection

In the reality, we have to do fake face detection in video. we can say video is a sequences of image of faces, but detecting each image of face may not be enough. so detection of fake face in video will be the second step.
